# Trainer notes

There are three main resources:

## Slide deck

- A [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hRk83kQ6jslyq6qZ42IXw74B4ukP3yEGGkppjNBST8o/edit?usp=sharing) containing supporting slides for various sections of the course. Notes are added to each slide, with information for both the students and the trainers.

## Practical materials

- [Course materials page](https://cambiotraining.github.io/data-analysis-in-r-and-python/), containing detailed explanations of the course content. These materials serve a few purposes:
  - For participants: it's a reference to use after the course (course notes).
  - For trainers: useful to prepare the delivery of materials, i.e. knowing what you should be demonstrating interactively during the course.
  - For exercises during the course - at the relevant point of the course you can point participants to section X for the exercise.

## Recordings

- Canonical [recordings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bhdaPMeVgmFNBS8qOBd5VfG8yb-BIyAI?usp=sharing) of the lecture parts, to use as preparation for trainers and to share with students afterwards - where applicable. Each set of recordings corresponds to the version of the slides (e.g. `DA1_2526.01_recording_getting-started.mp4` corresponds to the first session (`DA1`), using the `2526.01` slide deck).
