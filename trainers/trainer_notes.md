# Trainer notes

There are three main resources:

## Slide deck

- A [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hRk83kQ6jslyq6qZ42IXw74B4ukP3yEGGkppjNBST8o/edit?usp=sharing) containing supporting slides for various sections of the course. Notes are added to each slide, with information for both the students and the trainers.

## Practical materials

- [Course materials page](https://cambiotraining.github.io/data-analysis-in-r-and-python/), containing detailed explanations of the course content. These materials serve a few purposes:
  - For participants: it's a reference to use after the course (course notes).
  - For trainers: useful to prepare the delivery of materials, i.e. knowing what you should be demonstrating interactively during the course.
  - For exercises during the course - at the relevant point of the course you can point participants to section X for the exercise.

## Recordings

- Canonical [recordings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bhdaPMeVgmFNBS8qOBd5VfG8yb-BIyAI?usp=sharing) of the lecture parts, to use as preparation for trainers and to share with students afterwards - where applicable. Each set of recordings corresponds to the version of the slides (e.g. `DA1_2526.01_recording_getting-started.mp4` corresponds to the first session (`DA1`), using the `2526.01` slide deck).

## Course structure and timings

Below is an overview of the course structure and a very rough breakdown of the approximate timings. This is mainly useful to gauge how long to spend on each short lecture. The live coding and the time given to the students to work through the materials can vary a lot, depending on their background.

Of course there is ample flexibility regarding the timing of breaks etc. Just make sure that you do include the short lecture part for each individual section, since this gives the background information on the topic that is being covered.
