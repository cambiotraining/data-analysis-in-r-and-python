# Trainer notes

In general, there three two main resources:

- A [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hRk83kQ6jslyq6qZ42IXw74B4ukP3yEGGkppjNBST8o/edit?usp=sharing) containing supporting slides for various sections of the course (detailed below).
- [Course materials page](https://cambiotraining.github.io/data-analysis-in-r-and-python/), containing detailed explanations of the course content. These materials serve a few purposes:
  - For participants: it's a reference to use after the course (course notes).
  - For trainers: useful to prepare the delivery of materials, i.e. knowing what you should be demonstrating interactively during the course.
  - For exercises during the course - at the relevant point of the course you can point participants to section X for the exercise.
- A document with [live demo exercises](trainers-live-demo.qmd).

Below, we give details to help you prepare each section of the materials.
