These sessions provide an introduction to coding in R and Python. The aim is to get you comfortable with coding techniques commonly used in scientific research.

::: {.callout-tip}
### Learning objectives

- Get familiar with the R or Python programming language
- Learn to visualise data
- Be able to manipulate and transform data
:::


### Target audience

This course is aimed at people without any prior programming experience. It does however, allow people with some experience to further enhance their knowledge through different level exercises.


### Prerequisites

No prerequisites.


<!-- Training Developer note: comment the following section out if you did not assign levels to your exercises -->
### Exercises

Exercises in these materials are labelled according to their level of difficulty:

| Level | Description |
| ----: | :---------- |
| {{< fa solid star >}} {{< fa regular star >}} {{< fa regular star >}} | Exercises in level 1 are simpler and designed to get you familiar with the concepts and syntax covered in the course. |
| {{< fa solid star >}} {{< fa solid star >}} {{< fa regular star >}} | Exercises in level 2 combine different concepts together and apply it to a given task. |
| {{< fa solid star >}} {{< fa solid star >}} {{< fa solid star >}} | Exercises in level 3 require going beyond the concepts and syntax introduced to solve new problems. |
