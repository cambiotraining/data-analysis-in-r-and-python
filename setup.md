## Course attendees

If you are attending one of our courses, we might provide a training environment with all of the required software and data, depending on the format.

For in-person courses taking place at our training room in Cambridge, we have dedicated computers with all the required software. For online courses we generally expect participants to set up their own computer. Installation instructions are provided below.

In general we highly encourage everyone to have all the software installed locally, since that will allow you to use immediately all the tools you have learnt during the course.
